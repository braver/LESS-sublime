# Less syntax for Sublime Text 3

## Deprecated! ##

The repo has been merged back into LESS and we'll continue supporting and improving it there.

We're currently testing the new version of LESS. You can switch over now by:

1. Add LESS to package control's prerelease list:  
   ```json
   "install_prereleases":
   [
     "LESS"
   ]
   ```

2. Uninstall LessImproved
3. Install LESS

I hope to see everyone back at LESS and if you have questions, bugs or pull requests please send them here: https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime
